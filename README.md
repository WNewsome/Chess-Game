# Chess-Game
Video Game Design @ Virginia Tech course final project 

The project will consist of a traditional computer vs human chess board game. To achieve this, I will implement an appropriate artificial intelligence algorithm based on game theory concepts. The player should be able to select between different levels of difficulty that will define how deep the algorithm should explore in order to make decisions. The program will also have to define the rules that govern the state of the game as well as defining individual rules for each piece on the board. Several images and effects will be developed to make the game visually appealing and allow it to be realistic.

Topics to be used:
Action + Interaction
Tile-map
FSM/State-based design
Real-Time Strategy
Modeling intelligent behavior
